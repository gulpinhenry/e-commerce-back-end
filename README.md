## Description

Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. This program is the back end for an e-commerce site, by configuring a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database using bcrypt.js, dotenv, Express.js, MySQL, Node.js, Nodemon, and Sequelize. This project served as an exploration towards the back end and ORM.
